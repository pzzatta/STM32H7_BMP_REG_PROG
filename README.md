# STM32H7_BMP_REG_PROG
This is to set the system core clock frequency to 480 MHz using Bare Metal Programming.
It is just about register programming using the datasheet (DS12110 Rev 10, March 2023), 
reference manual (RM0433 Rev 8, January 2023) and the stm32h743xx.h header file.
The old main shows how to create your own macros and the other codes show how to use 
already defined macros by ST Microelectronics in stm32h743xx.h. As a precautionary measure,
it is always recommended to check the variables or macros of ST Microelectronics.
